		<h1>AERIAL YOGA</h1>
			<img class="hover" src="Images/aerialyoga1.jpg"><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerial yoga, also referred to as anti-gravity yoga, shares a lot similarities with traditional yoga. However, there’s a big difference. When participating in aerial yoga classes, the weight of your body will be supported by a hammock. This means you’ll be suspended in the air! It’s a great option for beginners and experienced yoga performers.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of performing yoga poses on a mat, aerial yoga utilizes a silk hammock or sling that is suspended from the ceiling to perform those same movements. The purpose of the hammock is to provide support through your yoga flow, while also improving flexibility and range of motion. The hammock also takes pressure off certain areas of the body like the head and shoulders, 
			allowing you to reach those more challenging poses like headstands with greater ease. Although most aerial yoga photos you'll find seem to showcase a yogi fully suspended in air, many aerial yoga poses only require you to take one body part such as your foot or leg off the ground.</p>
			
		  
		  <br><br>
		 
		 <h3>What to expect during your first Aerial Yoga class</h3><br><br>
		 <img class="hover" src="Images/aerialyoga2.jpg"><br><br>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerial yoga is very beginner friendly and it doesn't discriminate. It doesn't matter if a new student has been a lifelong yogi or this is their first experience with any form of yoga. Everything that is done in a class can be modified for all levels. On the other hand, if you do yoga on the reg, your aerial class will be pretty similar in that you'll be doing similar poses and asanas. You will flow through your warrior sequences, using the silk for an additional resistance, lengthening and balancing challenge. We often practice with poses traditionally done on the mat with the aid of the silk to go deeper.
		 Some poses include a low lunge, half-splits, camel pose, cat, cow, and many more.</p>

		<br><br>
		
		<h3>What to wear to an Aerial Yoga class</h3><br><br>
		<img class="hover" src="Images/aerialyoga3.jpg"><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear clothing that's comfortable and has some movement, but nothing too loose.
		You’d want a clothing that you can move around in easily and comfortably, but not so baggy that it gets caught in the hammock, or moves out of position when the hammock squeezes you and you start moving around.
		A long-sleeve top and leggings are ideal to help with the pressure from the hammock on your body. You also don’t want to wear clothing that will fall off when you hang upside-down, and you don’t want to expose 
		any parts of your skin that are sensitive, such as your armpits, lower back, back of the knees, or belly. Other things to leave behind for aerial classes? Jewelry that hangs and can get caught in the hammock.</p>

		<h3>Benefits of Aerial Yoga</h3><br><br>
		<img class="hover" src="Images/aerialyoga4.jpg"><br>
		<img class="hover" src="Images/aerialyoga5.jpg"><br><br>
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Great for Back Sufferers</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While everyone can benefit from aerial yoga classes, they’re especially great for people experiencing back pain. Because of the hammock’s support, far less pressure is placed upon your joints. Aerial yoga also doesn’t strain the spine, which is a huge advantage for back pain sufferers. You’ll be able to obtain a full body workout without any discomfort.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Helps with Breathing</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Controlled breathing is an important aspect of yoga. Aerial yoga allows you to breathe deeply with any restriction. While hanging in the air, you’ll be able to totally relax. Aerial yoga enables you to comfortably maintain every pose. Over time, you can even expect to improve your lung capacity.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Enhances Flexibility</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to maintain a great range of motion, you must consistently work on your flexibility. Aerial yoga class will definitely help you to safely stretch your muscles and tendons. Being suspended in the air gives you more space to move. This means you’ll be able to perform yoga poses that you can’t do on the floor.</p>
		
		<br><br><p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Stress Relief</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t underestimate the stress relief that stems from participating in aerial yoga classes. If you happen to be going through a rough time or experiencing anxiety attacks, aerial yoga will help put your mind at ease. It gives you an opportunity to meditate and focus on positive thoughts (while hanging upside-down!). Beyond just stress relief, the pros of being inverted include increased balance, more energy, and better focus. When you’re inverted, blood flows to your brain and provides oxygen it needs for brain function.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Burns Calories</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aerial yoga offers more than just peace and relaxation. It also helps burn calories through the balance it takes to stay control in the silks. Being suspended in the air requires a stable core as you change positions in a way a mat yoga class can’t. In fact, a study performed by the American Council on Exercise shows aerial yoga rivals the effectiveness of aerobic exercise. During a 50-minute aerial yoga session, you have the potential melt away 320 calories. After six weeks, your risk of cardiovascular disease will be significantly lower.
		<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an aerial yoga class, you perform the same poses you do on a yoga mat, except you use a silk hammock that's suspended from the ceiling as a prop to support you through the various flows. The purpose of the hammock is to help you improve flexibility and build strength, while allowing you to do more challenging poses without added pressure on your shoulders, spine, or head.</p>
