		<h1>BARRE</h1>
			<img class="hover" src="images/barre1.jpg"><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barre fitness is a hybrid workout class - combining ballet-inspired moves with elements of Pilates, dance, yoga and strength training. Most classes incorporate a ballet barre and use classic dance moves such as plies, alongside static stretches. Barre also focuses on high reps of small range movements.<br><br>
		  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the real difference between barre and other workouts are the isometric movements you usually perform - holding your body still while you contract specific muscles, until you shake and feel the burn!
		  <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of classes start with a warm up of push ups, tricep dips and planks, before moving to the barre, to focus on legs and your glutes. Then many classes end on the mat as you target the core, before a yoga-inspired cool-down. Some classes also use resistance bands and light 
		  hand weights to make the classes tougher to and to help build lean muscle, and mats for targeted core work.</p>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  
		  <h3>What is it best for?</h3><br><br>
		 <img class="hover" src="images/barre2.jpg"><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barre delivers a full body workout, but it's great for strengthening your core and toning your glutes and legs. Because ballet barre is low impact, it's great if you recovering from an injury (let the instructor know if you have an injury so they can modify exercises accordingly!). 
		   Many barre classes can also be modified so they are a safe workout option for pre or post-natal clients. Barre workouts are also a good cross-training option to pair with other exercise like running, weight lifting or cycling, because they strengthen the muscles needed for these exercises without being too stressful on the body.<br><br></p>
		  
		  <h3>What are the results like?</h3><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are the results like? Barre aficionados say that it takes just a few classes to see the difference in your body - and if you go to barre classes regularly you're likely to see increased strength and a more toned physique. <br><br></p>
		 
		   <br><br>
		   
		   <h3>The Benefits of Barre Workouts</h3><br><br>
		    <img class="hover" src="images/barre3.jpg"><br><br>
			<img class="hover" src="images/barre4.jpg"><br><br>
		   <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Improves Posture</b></p><br><br>
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“There’s a big focus on strengthening the muscles through the chest and shoulders in barre practice, which in turn prevents us from slouching,” Willoughby says. After just a few sessions, you’ll feel yourself standing taller with a sense of elongation throughout your body.
			A 2020 study investigated postural angles on participants partaking in ballet barre exercises for 50 minutes twice per week for 12 weeks. The results found that barre significantly improved head, shoulder, and pelvic posture.</p>
            
			<br><br>
		   
           <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Strengthens Glutes</b></p><br><br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, this extra toning is a win for us in the peachy rear department, but Willoughby explains that there’s more to it than a tightened bum. “More importantly, working on your glutes helps to strengthen all the muscles that stabilize the pelvis. This helps to alleviate pressure on the back, hips, and knees,” she says.</p>

			<br><br>
			
			<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Tones Stomach Muscles</b></p><br><br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because barre focuses heavily on balance and strength, your core is an integral part of the training. “As you use the abdominals to hold the body in a correct alignment, barre classes will give you a heavy core workout—perfect for keeping toned tummies in check,” says Willoughby. This can be especially helpful for postpartum mothers looking to bounce back.</p>

			<br><br>
			
			<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Increases Flexibility</b></p><br><br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of stretching and the focus on posture allows your flexibility to be pushed to the limit. This means fewer potential injuries and improved physical performance. By no means do you need to be the most graceful, swan-like prima ballerina at the barre (the movements are easy to adapt for all levels). Give yourself a few weeks and you’ll be surprised at how your flexibility increases.</p>

			<br><br>
			<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Reduces Stress</b></p><br><br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know that exercise, in general, helps to reduce stress,2 but whereas yoga quiets the mind and HIIT gets it all out, barre sits somewhere in between. Barre is a mental challenge, as each movement requires a level of mindfulness to stay engaged. It’s almost like a form of meditation, as your brain remains intensely focused on each small movement. You’ll leave each class feeling lifted and calm.</p>

			<br><br>
			
			<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Better Mental Focus</b></p><br><br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might find yourself being quick on your feet when it comes to thinking and problem solving after your barre session. Like stress, an exercise in general releases endorphins that keep your mind sharp. Research has shown the combination of pilates and yoga specifically (which is ultimately what barre is) may improve mental clarity and keep you thinking positively.</p>

			<br><br>
		
			<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Increases Overall Strength</b></p><br><br> 
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not feeling like lifting heavy weights, but want to improve your strength? No problem. With barre, you're often using only small hand weights (or none at all), resistance bands, and stability balls. You also don't have to worry about what day of the week leg day lands on. Barre exercises are full-body workouts, strengthening your arms, legs, and core all in one session.</p>

			<br><br>
			<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Improves Endurance</b></p><br><br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Endurance is more than improving your stamina for future workouts; it also impacts essential organs. The American Heart Association states that your heart, lungs, and circulatory system stay healthy when endurance activity, like barre, is incorporated into your routine. When you stay consistent with these exercises, you can reduce the risk of developing diseases like heart disease, stroke, and diabetes.</p>

		 <h3>Barre Workouts vs. Pilates</h3><br><br>
		  <img class="hover" src="images/barre5.jpg"><br><br>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barre and Pilates have similarities, but their relationship is more like cousins than siblings. A barre workout is influenced by both Pilates and yoga moves, but it tends to implement more repetitions at a higher tempo. Pilates, on the other hand, 
		 does minimal repetitions and follows a certain structure.<br><br></p>
