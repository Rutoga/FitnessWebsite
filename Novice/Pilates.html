		<h1>PILATES</h1>
			<img class="hover" src="Images/pilates1.jpg"><br><br>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilates is a method of exercise that consists of low-impact flexibility and muscular strength and endurance movements. Pilates emphasizes proper postural alignment, core strength and muscle balance. Pilates is named for its creator, Joseph Pilates, who developed the exercises in the 1920s.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Pilates routine generally includes exercises that promote core strength and stability, muscle control, and endurance, including exercises that stress proper posture and movement patterns and balanced flexibility and strength. It can also be helpful in training for sports or in physical rehabilitation.<br><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pilates method is taught to suit each person and exercises are regularly re-evaluated to ensure they are appropriate for that person. Due to the individual attention, this method can suit everybody from elite athletes to people with limited mobility, pregnant women and people with low fitness levels.</p>

		  <br><br>
		  
		 <h3>How It Works</h3><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pull out your gym mat and get ready to do a series of movements that will stabilize and strengthen your core.
		The exercises are usually done in a specific order, one right after another. The movements have names, like "The 100," Criss-Cross," the "Elephant," and the "Swan."
		The moves may look simple, but they take a lot of precision and control. It's not like doing a bunch of crunches; there's a strong emphasis on technique.
		You can do Pilates on an exercise mat, either in a class or at home, using a DVD. Or you can go to a gym or studio that has special equipment, a class, or a trainer who can supervise you.
		Pilates classes typically take 45 minutes to an hour, but you can do fewer moves in less time.
		You’ll get stronger, more sculpted muscles and gain flexibility. You may also have better posture and a better sense of well-being.
		Plan on doing this workout a few days a week, in addition to cardio, since Pilates isn't aerobic.</p>

		<br><br>

		<h3>Intensity Level: Medium</h3><br><br>
		<img class="hover" src="Images/pilates4.jpg"><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's demanding, but it's not the kind of workout that always works up a sweat. It’s all about concentration and breathing. But you’ll definitely feel it in your muscles during each exercise.</p>

		<br><br>
		
		 <h3>Areas It Targets</h3><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pilates’ main focus is on core however, you can expect to see strength gains in your arms and legs.  Positions and movements used to activate core rely on extremities to control &/or apply loads to the core and likewise will benefit from Pilates.</p>


		<h3>Type</h3><br><br>
		<li><b>Flexibility:</b> Yes. The exercises in a Pilates workout will boost your flexibility and joint mobility.</li>
		<li><b>Aerobic:</b>  No. This is not a cardio workout.</li>
		<li><b>	Strength:</b>  Yes. This workout will make your muscles stronger. You’ll use your own body weight instead of weights.</li>
		<li><b>	Low-Impact:</b>  Yes. You’ll engage your muscles in a strong but gentle way.</li>

		<br><br>
		
		<h3>What Else You Should Know</h3><br><br>
		<li><b>Good for beginners:</b> Yes. You can start with basic exercises then try advanced moves as you get better. If you’re starting out, opt for a class or private lessons so an instructor can keep an eye on your form to help prevent an injury.</li>
		<li><b>Outdoors:</b> No. Expect to go to the gym or be in a room with a TV for this workout.</li>
		<li><b>At home:</b>Yes. Pull out your mat and press play on your DVD player for a convenient at-home workout.</li>
		<li><b>Equipment required:</b> Yes, you’ll need a mat. Some gyms have special machines for Pilates, called a Reformer. You can get a modified version for your home, but you probably don’t need it.</li>

		
		 <br><br>

		 <h3>Types of Pilates?</h3><br><br>
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>The two basic forms of Pilates are:</b></p><br>
		<li><b>Mat-based Pilates</b> – this is a series of exercises performed on the floor using gravity and your own body weight to provide resistance. The main aim is to condition the deeper, supporting muscles of your body to improve posture, balance and coordination.</li>
		<br><br><img class="hover" src="Images/pilates2.jpg"><br><br>
		<li><b>Equipment-based Pilates</b>– this includes specific equipment that works against spring-loaded resistance, including the ‘reformer’, which is a moveable carriage that you push and pull along its tracks. Some forms of Pilates include weights (such as dumbbells) and other types of small equipment that offer resistance to the muscles.</li>
		<br><br><img class="hover" src="Images/pilates3.jpg">
		
		<br><br>
		<h3>Is Pilates for everyone</h3><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're older, haven't exercised for some time or have health problems, it's a good idea to check with your doctor before starting any new exercise program. Pilates is no exception. Similarly, women who are pregnant should check with their health care providers before starting Pilates or other exercise programs.
		Pilates can be adapted to provide a gentle strength training and stability program, or it can be modified to give a seasoned athlete a challenging workout. If you're just starting out, it's a good idea to go slow at first and gradually increase the intensity of your workout.
		Let your instructor know if you have any conditions or previous injuries so he or she can assist you in modifying movements.
		Because it's essential to maintain the correct form to get the most benefit — and to avoid injuries — beginners should start out under the supervision of an experienced Pilates instructor.</p>
