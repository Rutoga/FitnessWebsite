		<h1>POLE FITNESS</h1>
			<img class="hover" src="images/poleexercise3.jpg"><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pole Fitness is an extension of pole dancing that uses the pole to its maximum potential as a versatile piece of fitness equipment. It works the whole body, improving muscle tone, flexibility, coordination, posture as well as upper body and core strength.
			You’ll be amazed at the variety of exercises you can do with a pole, which are similar to exercises you might do in the gym, but using your own body weight for resistance. From chin ups to crunches to work your arms and abs and climbing to swan holds for your legs and bums - you can work it all on a pole.
			<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pole dancing has gained popularity as a form of exercise with increased awareness of the benefits to general strength and fitness. These forms of exercise increases core and general body strength by using the body itself as resistance, while toning the body as a whole. A typical pole dance exercise
			regimen in class begins with strength training, dance-based moves, squats, push-ups, and sit-ups and gradually works its way up to the spins, climbs and inversions which are the métier of the exercise. Pole dancing is also generally reported by its schools to be empowering for women in terms of building self-confidence,
			in terms of which its erotic components are still the subject of some controversy.Some feminists argue that sexualized dancing of this kind cannot be seen as empowering because the choice to participate is not made in freedom from constraining power structures, especially given the performative aspect of many classes.</p>

		  <br><br>
		  
		 
		 <h3>History of Pole Fitness</h3><br><br>
		 <img class="hover" src="images/poleexercise1.jpg"><br><br>
	     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of pole for sports and exercise has been traced back at least 800 years to the traditional Indian sport of mallakhamb, which utilizes principles of endurance and strength using a wooden pole, wider in diameter than a modern standard pole. The Chinese pole, originating in India, uses two poles on which men would perform "gravity defying tricks" as they leap from pole to pole, at approximately twenty feet in the air.
		 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pole dance in America has its roots in the "Little Egypt" traveling sideshows of the 1890s, which featured sensual "Kouta Kouta" or "Hoochie Coochie" belly dances, performed mostly by Ghawazi dancers making their first appearance in America. In an era where women dressed modestly in corsets, the dancers, dressed in short skirts and richly adorned in jewelry, caused quite a stir. During the 1920s, dancers introduced pole by sensually gyrating on the wooden tent poles to attract crowds. 
		 <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock and roll invasion in the 1950s saw the introduction of the pole to a wider audience, with Elvis Presley's "Jailhouse Rock" movie and video in 1957. The video featured Presley's famous gyrating hips as well as numerous pole slides, grinds, and twirls. Eventually the pole dancing moved from tents to bars, and combined with burlesque dance. Since the 1980s, pole dancing has incorporated athletic moves such as climbs, spins, and inversions into striptease routines, first in Canada
		 and then in the United States. In the 1990s, pole dancing commenced to be taught as an art by Fawnia Mondey, a Canadian who moved to Las Vegas, US. She is known as the world's first pole dancing instructor. Since then, pole dancing classes have become a popular form of recreational and competitive sport, practiced and performed in a variety of sexual, non-sexual, and athletic settings.</p>
		
		
		<h3>Most people who take pole fitness/dances,<br>regardless of age, are in the best shape of their lives</h3><br><br>
		 <img class="hover" src="images/poleexercise2.jpg"><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pole dancing is a full-body workout. It is resistance training and cardio in one, and flexibility is improved as well. Pole dancers perform acrobatic tricks either suspending their weight or propelling it around a metal pole. The simple act of climbing a pole is an incredible display of strength. It is no surprise, then, that most pole dancers insist they have never looked or felt better.</p>

	    <h3>Benefits of Pole Fitness</h3><br><br>
		 <img class="hover" src="images/poleexercise5.jpg"><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pole fitness is an intense full body workout. In particular, you’ll work your upper body, core and thighs. Pole dancing involves repeatedly lifting your own body weight for extended periods of time, climbing up a vertical pole with no foot-holds and inverting your body.
		This may sound impossible if you’ve never tried it before, but with some determination, all pole dancers gain strength incredibly quickly. You will start to notice an improvement in your strength almost instantly.</p>
		 
		<br><br>
		  
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Increased Flexibility</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another one of the great health benefits of pole dancing is that it increases your flexibility. The importance of flexibility is often overlooked. Being flexible makes you healthier in many ways; it reduces your risk of muscle injury and minimizes muscle soreness.
		Pole fitness definitely improves your flexibility. Many pole dancers chase their dream of being able to do box splits – why? Because they look amazing, that’s why!</p>
		
				 
		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Increased Cardiovascular Health</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cardiovascular health is no important, having a healthy heart lowers the risk or heart disease, strokes and heart attacks
		Pole fitness is just as effective for your heart as any other moderate-to-intense training. With pole fitness, all of your muscles are being worked so the blood is flowing to all of them and this is a great cardiovascular workout.
		If your job entails sitting down at a desk for long periods of time, then it’s even more important for you to increase your heart rate by exercising 3-4 times per week.</p>
		 
		 		 
		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Lose Weight And Burn calories</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All forms of exercise will help you trim the excess fat. but, did you know that pole dancing can burn the same number of calories in 30 minutes as aerobics or callisthenics? Well, it’s true! I’m sure many people feel as if they could lose a few pounds. Well, pole fitness/dancing is the perfect way to do it!
		Pole fitness is an intense full-body workout and works the muscles in a more intense way than many other forms of exercise. Using a pole for your workouts will lead to a more sustainable weight loss over a long period of time.</p>
		
		<br><br>
			
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Improved Coordination And Rhythm</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you learn pole dancing you’ll most likely want to put all of your spins and moves together into a routine.
		Part of the fun of pole dancing is finding the perfect song, picking your best moves and choreographing them with your personal style.
		Don’t worry if you feel clumsy, ungrateful or as if you have ‘two left feet’. Your natural rhythm and style will come with practice.</p>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Better Body Confidence</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few months of pole fitness, you’ll definitely notice a change in your body. You’ll be stronger, your muscles will feel firmer and you’ll be less fatigued. With this comes increased body confidence.
		You’ll soon start to be able to wear clothes which cling to parts of your body you’d never dream of showing off before. That really is a wonderful feeling and with a regular pole workout, you’ll feel more body confident in no time!</p>
		
		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Reduced Stress And Anxiety</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alongside this new found body confidence, the endorphins released by exercise will reduce your overall stress levels.
		If you do have a stressful day, a hardcore pole workout is a great way to relieve stress! This is because adrenaline builds up when we get stressed. A good workout session using the pole will work every muscle in your body – such a perfect way to release all of that extra adrenaline.
		You’ll definitely be in a calmer state of mind after your pole dance workout.</p>
		
		<br><br>

		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Healthier Sleep</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the little-known health benefits of pole fitness is that pole dancers enjoy better sleep. Getting enough sleep is equally as important as exercise and eating a healthy diet. Sadly, not many people get enough sleep because they find it too difficult. Work, money, technology, and lack of exercise are often to blame.
		If you ensure that you exercise every day, with time you’ll start to notice your sleeping patterns improving and you’ll feel more refreshed after waking up too. A regular pole dancing workout will help with your sleep routine, ensuring that you get a decent sleep every time you hit the sack.</p>

		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Healthier Joints And Bones</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we age, our bones lose mineral density, especially us women. The risk of women getting osteoporosis gets higher the older we get, so it’s vital that we keep our bones and joints healthy.
		Pole fitness/dancing strengthens muscles, joints and connecting tissue. During a pole session, you’ll put less stress on your joints than you would if you were running or doing an aerobics class. However, it’s still important to warm-up and cooldown properly to reduce injury.</p>
