		<h1>YOGA</h1>
			<img class="hover" src="images/yoga1.jpg"><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoga is an ancient practice that involves physical poses, concentration, and deep breathing. A regular yoga practice can promote endurance, strength, calmness, flexibility, and well-being.
			The first mention of the word “yoga” appears in Rig Veda, a collection of ancient texts. Yoga comes from the Sanskrit word “yuj,” which means “union” or “to join.”Yoga can be traced back to northern India over 5,000 years ago. 
			Indian monks spread their knowledge of yoga in the West during the late 1890s. Modern yoga teachings became widely popular in Western countries by the 1970s.</p>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  
		  <h3>Philosophy of Yoga</h3><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The overall philosophy of yoga is about connecting the mind, body, and spirit.
		  There are six branches of yoga. Each branch represents a different focus and set of characteristics.</p>
		  <li><b>Hatha yoga:</b> This is the physical and mental branch that aims to prime the body and mind.</li>
		  <li><b>Raja yoga:</b> This branch involves meditation and strict adherence to a series of disciplinary steps known as the eight limbs of yoga.</li>
		  <li><b>Karma yoga:</b> This is a path of service that aims to create a future free from negativity and selfishness.</li>
		  <li><b>Bhakti yoga:</b> This aims to establish the path of devotion, a positive way to channel emotions and cultivate acceptance and tolerance.</li>
		  <li><b>Jnana yoga:</b> This branch of yoga is about wisdom, the path of the scholar, and developing the intellect through study.</li>
	      <li><b>Tantra yoga:</b> This is the pathway of ritual, ceremony, or consummation of a relationship.</li>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  
		  <h3>Chakras</h3><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word <b>“chakra”</b> means “spinning wheel.”<br><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoga maintains that chakras are center points of energy, thoughts, feelings, and the physical body. According to yogic teachers, chakras determine how people experience reality through emotional reactions, desires or aversions, levels of confidence or fear, and even physical symptoms and effects.<br><br>
		 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When energy becomes blocked in a chakra, it triggers physical, mental, or emotional imbalances that manifest in symptoms such as anxiety, lethargy, or poor digestion.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asanas are the many physical poses in Hatha yoga. People who practice yoga use asanas to free energy and stimulate an imbalanced chakra.
		  <br><br><b>There are seven major chakras, each with its own focus:</b></p><br><br>
		  <li><b>Sahasrara:</b> The crown chakra, which is at the crown of the head, symbolizes spiritual connection.</li>
	 	  <li><b>Ajna:</b> Located between the eyebrows, the third eye chakra has to do with intuition.</li>
	      <li><b>Vishuddha:</b> The throat chakra corresponds to immunity and verbal communication.</li>
	      <li><b>Anahata:</b> The heart chakra, which is in the center of the chest, influences professional and personal relationships. Any imbalances in this chakra will affect oxygen, hormones, tissue, and organ control.</li>
	      <li><b>Manipura:</b> The solar plexus chakra is in the stomach area. It corresponds to self-confidence, wisdom, and self-discipline.</li>
	      <li><b>Svadhishthana:</b> The sacral chakra, which is beneath the belly button, connects pleasure, well-being, and vitality.</li>
	      <li><b>Muladhara:</b> The root chakra, which is at the base of the spine, connects the mind and body to the earth to keep a person grounded. It controls the sciatic nerves and the parasympathetic nervous system.</li>

			  <br><br>

		  
		  <h3>Risks and Side Effects</h3><br><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many types of yoga are relatively mild and therefore safe for people when a well-trained instructor is guiding the practice.
			It is rare to incur a serious injury when doing yoga. The most common injuries among people practicing yoga are sprains and strains.
			However, people may wish to consider a few risk factors before starting a yoga practice.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person who is pregnant or has an ongoing medical condition, such as bone loss, glaucoma, or sciatica, should consult a healthcare professional, if possible, before taking up yoga.
			Some people may need to modify or avoid some yoga poses that could be risky given their specific condition.
			Beginners should avoid advanced poses and difficult techniques, such as Headstand, Lotus Pose, and forceful breathing.
			When managing a condition, people should not replace conventional medical care with yoga or postpone seeing a healthcare professional about pain or any other medical problem.<br><br></p>

		   <h3>The Benefits of Yoga</h3><br><br><br>
		   <img class="hover" src="images/yoga2.jpg"><br><br>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoga offers physical and mental health benefits for people of all ages. And, if you’re going through an illness, recovering from surgery or living with a chronic condition, yoga can become an integral part of your treatment and potentially hasten healing. 
			A yoga therapist can work with patients and put together individualized plans that work together with their medical and surgical therapies. That way, yoga can support the healing process and help the person experience symptoms with more centeredness and less distress.</p>

		   <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Yoga improves Strength, Balance and Flexibility</b></p><br><br>
		   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slow movements and deep breathing increase blood flow and warm up muscles, while holding a pose can build strength.
			<br><br><b>Try it: Tree Pose</b><br>Balance on one foot, while holding the other foot to your calf or above the knee (but never on the knee) at a right angle. Try to focus on one spot in front of you, while you balance for one minute.</p>
			<br><br>
		    <img class="hover" src="images/yoga3.jpg">
		   <br><br>
			
		   <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Yoga helps with back pain relief</b></p><br><br>
		   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yoga is as good as basic stretching for easing pain and improving mobility in people with lower back pain. The American College of Physicians recommends yoga as a first-line treatment for chronic low back pain.<br><br>
			<b>Try it: Cat-Cow Pose</b><br>Get on all fours, placing your palms underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips. First, inhale, as you let your stomach drop down toward the floor. Then, exhale, as you draw your navel toward your spine, arching your spine like a cat stretching.</p>

		    <p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Yoga can ease arthritis symptoms</b></p><br><br>
		 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gentle yoga has been shown to ease some of the discomfort of tender, swollen joints for people with arthritis, according to a Johns Hopkins review of 11 recent studies.</p>
		 
		 <br><br>

		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Yoga benefits heart health</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regular yoga practice may reduce levels of stress and body-wide inflammation, contributing to healthier hearts. Several of the factors contributing to heart disease, including high blood pressure and excess weight, can also be addressed through yoga.<br><br>
		<b>Try it: Downward Dog Pose</b><br>Get on all fours, then tuck your toes under and bring your sitting bones up, so that you make a triangle shape. Keep a slight bend in your knees, while lengthening your spine and tailbone.</p>

		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Yoga relaxes you, to help you sleep better</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research shows that a consistent bedtime yoga routine can help you get in the right mindset and prepare your body to fall asleep and stay asleep.<br><br>
		<b>Try It: Legs-Up-the-Wall Pose</b><br>Sit with your left side against a wall, then gently turn right and lift your legs up to rest against the wall, keeping your back on the floor and your sitting bones close to the wall. You can remain in this position for 5 to 15 minutes.</p>
         
		 <br><br>
		    <img class="hover" src="images/yoga5.jpg">
			
		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Yoga can mean more energy and brighter moods</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may feel increased mental and physical energy, a boost in alertness and enthusiasm, and fewer negative feelings after getting into a routine of practicing yoga.</p>
		
		<br><br>

		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Yoga helps you manage stress</b></p><br><br>
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the National Institutes of Health, scientific evidence shows that yoga supports stress management, mental health, mindfulness, healthy eating, weight loss and quality sleep.<br><br>
		<b>Try It: Corpse Pose (Savasana)</b><br>Lie down with your limbs gently stretched out, away from the body, with your palms facing up. Try to clear your mind while breathing deeply. You can hold this pose for 5 to 15 minutes.</p>
		
		<br><br>

		<br><br>
		
		<p style="text-align:left;margin-left:100px;"><b>Yoga connects you with a supportive community</b></p><br><br> 
		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participating in yoga classes can ease loneliness and provide an environment for group healing and support. Even during one-on-one sessions loneliness is reduced as one is acknowledged as a unique individual, being listened to and participating in the creation of a personalized yoga plan.</p>
